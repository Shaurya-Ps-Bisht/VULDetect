# VULDetect
We propose VULDetect: a computation efficient and highly accurate ensemble based software system vulnerability detection framework trained on a large C/C++ file corpus comprising thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable source code snippets. VULDetect uses a deep learning based ensemble classifier model comprising three different base-level classifiers namely, Long Short-Term Memory, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit for performing vulnerability assessment of the software programs.

## Problem Statement
Classification of C source code files as vulnerable or non-vulnerable using Deep learning and Word Embedddings.
